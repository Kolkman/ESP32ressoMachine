        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The project covers somewhat advances features for an espresso machine temperature controller. The basic idea was to have
            reproducible "espresso results" due to temperature regulation and being able to fine-tune. Especially small
            machines have a low heat capacity and quality suffers a lot from different heat-up-times and high hysteresis
            in standard temperature switches. This <i>fork</i> was specifically developed for a Rancilio Silvia (v1)
            which are known to have fluctuations up to 20 degrees Celcius.
        </p>
 
        

        <p>
            With this project you should be able to install a PID for about 30 Euro of material, some soldering,
            uploading
            the firmware, and installling the hardware.
        </p>

        <p>
            The homepage presents a simple temperature gauge, a power indicator, and the ability to turn the heater on or
            off. The configuration page contains all that is needed for setting the various parameters that control
            the temperature. It contains a graph that presents the last 10 minutes of data so you see what the impact is
            of
            your tuning. When the page is loaded it initiates its buffer with a few minutes of data from board. Setting
            the
            parameters us done using a username and password (currently a value set at compilation time).

        </p>
        <p>
            Most of the interaction with the ESP32Machine is done via an restful API. All parameters can be set or read
            through it.
            In addition there is an MQTT interface that is used to publish the machines's current status.
        </p>
        <p>
            The screenshoots will give you an idea how things look.



        <h2>Buid Background</h2>
  
        <h3> Software</h3>
        <p>
            This project refactored from the original <a href="https://github.com/Schm1tz1/ESPressIoT">ESPressIoT
                project by
                Roman Schmit</a> originally written for an ESP3866 board with a TSIC sensor.
        </p>
        <p>
            This <i>fork</i> ports that code to an ESP32 with a MAX31855 amplified K thermocouple. It has been
            refactored it to be more object oriented and graphically more appealing. It has some small optimisations
            to deal with measurement noise and ones that allow for marginally faster convergence. Overal the temperature 
            stability is about 0.2 degrees centrigrade.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            For development I used platformIO on Visual Studio Code MAX. The toolchain relies on having <A
                href=https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=josee9988.minifyall">MinifyAll</A> installed.
        </p>
        <p>

            The code relies on the following libraries:
        <ul>
            <li><A href="https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library">Arduino-PID-Library v1</A></li>
            <li><A href="https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson">ArduinoJSON v6</A></li>
            <li><A href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-MAX31855-library">Adafruit-MAX31855</A></li>
            <li><A href="https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoStreamUtils/"></A>ArduinoStreamUtils</li>
            <li><A href="https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient">PubSubClient</A></li>
            <li><A href="https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer">ESPAsyncWebServer</A>(Currently we
                are using <A href="https://github.com/esphome/ESPAsyncWebServer.git">this fork</A>, as the original code
                has stability issues in the event handling</li>
        </ul>
        The webserver serves a local copy of <A href="https://bernii.github.io/gauge.js/">Gauge.js</A> but the web
        frontend will also download a remote
        copy of <A href="https://d3js.org">d3j version 4</A> from d3js.org.

        </p>
        <h3>Hardware</h3>

        <p>
            For the hardware setup I followed the example from <A
                href="https://www.instructables.com/PID-Controlled-Thermostat-Using-ESP32-Applied-to-a/"> "Bnayalivne's
                Instructable page"</A> I used a
            splitter to solder
            a USB charger to. And the whole circuit I installed in the space
            behind the frontplate, in a small plastic bag keep it dry from the drip plate.
        </p>

        <p>Whilst the Fotek should be able to handle the 3.3 V output from the
            GPIO it failed doing so. The small circuit with the transistor, resistor, and the
            diode (against flowback) uses the GPIO defined in heater.ino to switch the output from
            the 5v voltage pin.
        </p>

            the errors introduced are mine.
